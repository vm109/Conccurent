// Multi threading in web development

1. Can we use multithreading in webserver to increase the speed?
a. No, we should prevent to use multithreading in webserver because it will 
reduce the capability of the web server to handle the ther Http requests.


2. What is static method and non static method synchronization and what is 
the important thing to note?
We can have static method synchronization which means we will get the lock 
on the class level.
In the non static method we will get the lock on the instance level.
Note : 
So by this even a thread acquires a lock on the static method another thread
can access the non static method.
